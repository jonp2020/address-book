# Address book

## About

This is a web application that allows users to create an address book where they can add, update and remove contacts. In the current version, data is stored in a json file.

Express has been used to create a server with endpoints where data can be sent to and from the backend.

The front-end has been developed with HTML and vanilla JavaScript. Bootstrap 5 has been used for most of the styling, with a little bit of additional styling added in a separate css stylesheet I added.

## Getting started

### Installation

1. To begin with, (fork and) clone this repo.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jonp2020/address-book.git
```

2. Navigate into the directory and install the required dependencies to run the application:

```
$ cd address-book
$ npm install
```

3. Next, navigate into the backend folder and start the server.

```
$ cd backend
$ npm start
```

This should start the server running on localhost:9090

4. Once the server is running, you can open the index.html file located in the frontend folder to begin interacting with the app.

More additions and testing will follow in the future!
